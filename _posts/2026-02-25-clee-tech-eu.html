<p><a href="https://www.cleemedical.com/">Clee Medical</a>, a Swiss neurotechnology startup developing ultra-high-resolution real-time imaging for brain surgery, has closed its seed financing round. The round was led by <a href="https://www.htgf.de/en/">High-Tech Gründerfonds (HTGF)</a>, with participation from Zürcher Kantonalbank (ZKB), Kickfund, FONGIT, and Venture Kick, alongside continued support from existing partner Wyss Geneva.</p>

<p>Many neurosurgical procedures require navigating delicate brain structures with millimetre-level precision, yet anatomical shifts and limited intraoperative visibility can make targeting during surgery challenging. Clee Medical is developing minimally invasive neurotechnology solutions to address this gap.</p>

<p>Founded in October 2024 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-lapinski/">Matt Lapinski</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-abed-hammoud/">Abed Hammoud</a>, the company's flagship Neuro Access platform combines ultra-high-resolution real-time intraoperative Optical Coherence Tomography imaging with advanced navigation capabilities to support precision neurosurgery. The technology is designed to provide real-time imaging inside the brain, helping surgeons navigate complex anatomy with greater confidence and enabling safer access to deep brain targets for more targeted neurotherapies.</p>

<p>Built on years of translational research, the platform is being developed to support applications including functional neurosurgery and neuro-oncology.</p>

<p>With the new financing, Clee Medical plans to expand its development and clinical programs, advance toward its first-in-human clinical study, and accelerate the clinical validation of Neuro Access.</p>

<p>The company's long-term vision is to enable neurosurgeons to operate with enhanced real-time insight, improving safety, efficiency, and patient outcomes in complex brain procedures.</p>
